##  Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Example 1:
```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
Solution  
```
func lengthOfLongestSubstring(s string) int {
    
}
```

##  Median of Two Sorted Arrays


There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.  

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).  

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.  
Example 1:
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
Example 2:
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
Solution:
```
func findMedianSortedArrays(nums1 []int, nums2 []int) float64 {
    
}
```
